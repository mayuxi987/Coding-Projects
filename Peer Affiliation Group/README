# Peer Affiliation Group

The R scripts have two functions. 

1. SCM formatting

This is the R script that helps to simplify the data-processing procedures in a research project related to peer affiliation. 
The main functions of this script are:

- re-organizing the data format
- deleting the repeated values in each row 
- using the for-loop to generate the text files at once 

2. Identification 

This is the following R script helps to identify the primary membership which is generated by SCM (social cognitive mapping) software. 
The new functions and usages that I have learnt from this scripts include: 

- duplicate(), help to find the duplicates in the matrix, return the same data type (e.g, data.frame returns data.frame)
- %in% operator, which helps to compare whether the values in the vector occur in another vector, return the logical value. 
- subset(), another similar function, dataset[which(), which()]
